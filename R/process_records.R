#' Clean up raw records
#'
#' Uses functions from the \code{dplyr} package to clean up raw records obtained
#'  from the Bath: Hacked datastore. The process is as follows:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item Select columns containing useful information only
#'  \item Remove any records with NA entries
#'  \item Remove records for "test car park"
#'  \item Convert Name and Status to factors
#'  \item Remove records with negative occupancies
#'  \item Calculate Proportion column (Occupancy/Capacity)
#'  \item Remove records with Proportion greater than \code{max_prop}
#'  \item Remove duplicate records (see \code{first_upload})
#' }
#'
#' @param x A data frame containing records to be cleaned up (e.g. the data
#'  frame obtained by calling \code{\link{get_all_crude}}).
#' @param max_prop The point at which records are discarded due to overly-full
#'  Occupancy values (default is 1.1, or 110\% full, to allow for circulating
#'  cars).
#' @param first_upload If \code{TRUE}, ensures that when duplicate records are
#'   removed, the copy which is kept is the first one uploaded after the record
#'   was taken. This takes much longer to run, due to sorting.
#' @return A data frame of clean records, with 7 columns:
#' \describe{
#'  \item{Name}{The name of the car park where the record was taken.}
#'  \item{LastUpdate}{The time the record was taken (POSIXct date-time object).}
#'  \item{DateUploaded}{The time the record was uploaded to the Bath: Hacked
#'      database (POSIXct date-time object).}
#'  \item{Occupancy}{The total number of cars in the car park.}
#'  \item{Capacity}{The number of parking spaces in the car park.}
#'  \item{Status}{Description of the change in occupancy since the previous
#'      record from that car park.}
#'  \item{Proportion}{Calculated as (Occupancy/Capacity).}
#' }
