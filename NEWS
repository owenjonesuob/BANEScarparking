BANEScarparking v0.1.5 (Release date: 2017-08-27)
=================================================

Additions:

* Individual by-month/by-carpark datasets removed, because:
  - Names containing numbers, underscores and plus-signs were difficult to use (often needed to be enclosed in backticks) and were also causing R CMD check (and hence Travis build) to fail
  - These datasets were just subsets of `full_dataset` and so were somewhat unnecessarily increasing the size of the package. It's simple enough to filter `full_dataset` to a specific carpark or date range if needed.
* Travis CI is now being used to check the build
* Updated to MIT license
* @rkenning has proper credit as an author/contributor
* NEWS file added to keep a record of changes

Bugfixes:

* `get_events_detail` now correctly references functions from other packages, and it has a shiny new progress bar.
* `get_events` would fail if you tried to start from the first day of a month. It doesn't do that any more. And it was jealous of `get_events_detail`'s progress bar, so it has one too.
* `get_rugby` just plain wasn't working. It is now.
* Examples in documentation have been corrected.





BANEScarparking v0.1.4 (Release date: 2017-08-18)
=================================================

Additions:

* `get_daily_weather` grabs a daily weather summary from [wunderground.com](https://www.wunderground.com/) for each day in a range of dates
* `get_events_detail` (written by @rkenning) expands on `get_events` by grabbing more information about each event in a range of dates

Bugfixes:

* Bugfixes for `get_events` and `get_rugby`, which had stopped working due to strange redirects on the websites they scrape
* Updates to associated documentation





BANEScarparking v0.1.3 (Release date: 2017-04-06)
=================================================

Additions:

* `get_events` is now more specific: it can bring in counts from any date range, rather than being restricted to month-long blocks

Bugfixes:

* Bugfixes for webscraping functions (i.e. they now work as expected)
* Full dataset of parking records renamed full_dataset (intuitive, right? I don't know why it wasn't called that already)
* Updates to associated documentation




BANEScarparking v0.1.2 (Release date: 2017-02-12)
=================================================

Additions:

* `get_range_crude` for retrieving a subset of raw records




BANEScarparking v0.1.1 (Release date: 2017-01-11)
=================================================

  - Daily weather summary from 2014-10-17 to 2016-12-27
  - Dates and kick-off times for Bath Rugby home matches from 2014-09 to 2016-12
  - Daily count of events advertised at [www.bath.co.uk/events] from 2014-10 to 2016-12

* Web-scraping functions for obtaining rugby and event count info:
  - `get_rugby`
  - `get_events`
  
* Welcome messages displayed when package is loaded




BANEScarparking v0.1.0 (Release date: 2017-01-10)
=================================================

Additions:

  - `refine` for processing the raw records
  - `refuel` and `refuel_crude` for updating existing data frames with recent records
